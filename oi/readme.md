# oi: Login but only the vowels

> this document is available in [vowel form](eae.md)

this is the source code for [oi](https://luminousherbs.github.io/oi/), a [Login](https://todepond.com/lab/login) client which only displays the best 19% of the alphabet.

- client side stuff in `index.html`
- custom styles in `style.css`
- server side stuff on [val.town](https://www.val.town/u/todepond) (check `index.html` to find names of the different vals)
