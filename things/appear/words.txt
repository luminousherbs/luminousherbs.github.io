<p>
This
page
appears
one
word
at
a
time,
one
word
every
tick,
until
the
whole
page
is
complete.
If
you're
impatient,
you
can
find
all
the
content
<a href="/things/appear/words.txt">here</a>.
</p><p>
The
JavaScript
process
makes
sure
<em>every</em>
HTML
tag
is
supported,
but
wrapping
multiple
words
in
one
tag
is
<strong>not
possible</strong>.
</p><p>
If
I
use
multiple
line
breaks,
the


text


appears


much


slower,


and
if
I
don't
use
any,
it all appears immediately.
</p><p>




This
means
I
can
vary
the
time
between
each
word,
like
this:

.
.
.
.
.<br><br>

Never
gonna
give

you

up,<br>

Never
gonna
let

you

do-
-o-own,<br>
Never
gonna
run

a-
round

and

de
-sert

you.<br>



Never
gonna
make

you

cry,<br>

Never
gonna
SAAY

good-
bye-

yeye,<br>
Never
gonna
tell

a
lie



and
hurt

you.
